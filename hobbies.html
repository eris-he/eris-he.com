                <p>I've been playing violin since I was 5 years old. Of course, to me, it's one of the greatest passions of my life. It introduced me to the world of music, and that alone is worth something.</p>
                <p>My favorite composer is probably Tchaikovsky or Sarasate. I'm the type who likes those crazy, romantic pieces--all the better if I can show off a little while playing it!</p>
                <p>My violin is a 2004 John Sipe, and I currently am having an electric violin made, which was handpainted by my sister.</p>

                <p>I'll admit it--I'm one of the 90% of people who like playing video games. It's nothing that special, but I do get a lot of joy from playing, although I don't have a lot of time to play.</p>
                <p>Some of my favorite games are Hades, Persona 5, Transistor, Stardew Valley, and Genshin Impact (that last one being one of the only things I have time for right now).</p>
                <p>Other than that, I do dabble in MMOs and RPGs, and I'm waiting with excitement for Ashes of Creation to come out!</p>

                <p>I am first and foremost a creative writer; I do my best work when I am inspired to put characters through a wondrous, sometimes horrifying world. So of course, I specialize in fiction and fantasy.</p>
                <p>While I prefer to remain anonymous in my writing, I have had my works published before! It's a great point of pride for me, that people have read my work and enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>Someone once told me that writing is a form of human connection, that something in me touched something in someone else. I hope that I continue touching people's souls through my writing and my work.</p>
