  </h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Developed for a local coffee shop, Well Red, this web app allows users to browse and search the shop's current book inventory. Users can also reserve books for pickup at the shop, or request books that are not in stock.
        Admins are able to manage users, manage reservations and requests, and update the inventory.
    </p>
    <p>Notably, the site is connected to the shop's Square account so that the inventory is automatically updated when books are sold.
        This project also includes a barcode scanner that allows admins to quickly scan books and add them to the inventory. It also allows admins to update the Square inventory from the physical inventory.

    <p> As part of the branding overhaul for Auburn University's webpages, I helped develop the masterpage that would be used for all of the university's webpages.

  </h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>From the robocup.org website: "RoboCup is an international scientific initiative with the goal to advance the state of the art of intelligent robots."
        More specifically, it is about developing robots that can play soccer autonomously.</p>
    <p>I was part of the Georgia Tech Robojackets team, specializing in the electrical and software aspects of the robots.
        We competed specifically in the SSL (Small Size League) division, which uses robots that are about 7 inches in diameter to play an 11 vs 11 match.
